# Software Engineering
This is one aspect of the pipeline; the goal is to familiarize oneself on how to request and respond to data. 

## Theoretical Task
Learn about
- Client Server Architecture (request and response)
- What is Localhost?
- What is an API?
- What is an REST API?
- What is an Idempotent REST API?
- HTTP Response Status Codes


## Practical Task
Learn Flask/Django. Make an API request (using POSTMAN) that sends a random string and Flask/Django responds with a random number.
