# Capstone

## :thought_balloon: Background

Train an ML model identifying persons and other classes. Deploy the model to a Flask/Django project, which acts as an API. The Flask/Django project should send responses to 2 API calls.
* A HTTP request, containing an image, is made to the API. The API responds with the classes detected in that image.
* A HTTP request is made to the API asking for how many images were sent for inference and the cumulative number of individual classes detected so far. The API responds with the necessary values.
